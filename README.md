# **SVM model on Parkinson's Disease Classification**
### A Support Vector Machine model developed to classifiy patients on the basis of Parkinson's Disease.
The dataset is extracted from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons). After reducing the dimesnions using PCA, the data is found to be not linearly separable.
Hence, for the model, used a RBF kernel with varying C and Gamma values to determine the optimum solution for the classification. The project also includes a simple but efficient GUI.

Language-
- Python

Tool for GUI-
- Tkinter
